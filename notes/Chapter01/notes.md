## Chapter 1 notes

**1.2 - 1.3**

How web applications.

The common understanding of what web apps are, may not be straight forward. **Is a web service** also an **application**?
Many consider them different. Primarily because **web services** are consumed by other software whereas **web applications are used by humans** .

In a purist sense, a web application is a computer program that responds to HTTP request that a client sends them over HTML back to the client as an HTTP response. This definition also applies to a web server, there is no distinction between a web app and a web server by the aforementioned definition.

However, consider that a webserver such as httpd or Apache looks into a particular directory ( as in Apache's doc root ) and returns the files in that directory.


In comparison a web application doesn't simply return files; it processes the request and performs operations that are programmed in the application. Web App requests, performs programmed operations, returns files.

    If a program doesn't render HTML to a user but instead returns data in a any other format to another program
    It is a web service.

 **HTTP** is an **application-level communications protocol that powers the World Wide Web. Everything on a web page is transported through the simple HTTP.
